backend-challenge test
=================

Setup
-----
* Clone the repository `https://github.com/shunlll999/backend-challenge.git`
* Setup dependencies `yarn` or `npm install`

Running Standalone
------------------

* Start the application in development mode `npm start` but I prefer `yarn start`

> Note: This starts the application with linting and tests debugging.
